# Defaul Rate Prediction: Machine Learning

Data and Reference: the data set is from the https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients and the relevent paper is Yeh, I. C., & Lien, C. H. (2009). The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients. Expert Systems with Applications, 36(2), 2473-2480.

Object of this Machine Learing is to  use Machine Learning Methods as logistic regression, KNN, and SVM to compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default rate.

The the response variable (Y) is Â a binary variable, default payment (Yes = 1, No = 0).  The explanatory variables are :

X1: Amount of the given credit (NT dollar): it includes both the individual consumer credit and his/her family (supplementary) credit. 
X2: Gender (1 = male; 2 = female). 
X3: Education (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others). 
X4: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others). 
X5: Age (year). 
X6 - X11: History of past payment. We tracked the past monthly payment records (from April to September, 2005) as follows: X6 = the repayment status in September, 2005; X7 = the repayment status in August, 2005; . . .;X11 = the repayment status in April, 2005. The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above. 
X12-X17: Amount of bill statement (NT dollar). X12 = amount of bill statement in September, 2005; X13 = amount of bill statement in August, 2005; . . .; X17 = amount of bill statement in April, 2005. 
X18-X23: Amount of previous payment (NT dollar). X18 = amount paid in September, 2005; X19 = amount paid in August, 2005; . . .;X23 = amount paid in April, 2005. 

The results of machine learning could be used to predic credible or not credible clients for credit card application.
